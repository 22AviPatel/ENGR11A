My goal was to be a bit creative with the font/or layout. So, I used PruzaSlicer to experiment with changing the rotation of the font. It looks good and I’m pleased with it. In the actual print, I wasn’t attentive to what color the plastic would be, but I’m still pleased with the color. Then, I added the second color with the second spool. When I was actually hounding the final print in my hands I didn’t realize that there would be 3 circles on the bottom side. I didn’t even think about the bottom size of the print when I was editing it in PruzaSlizer. Next time I would like to see if I can print something with more text like a luggage tag. Maybe I’ll print it in these machines as a prototype, but I’m curious how durable the material is.

        I printed a wire holder horizontally vs vertically. I noted the time difference between printing it horizontally (21 minutes) versus vertically (56 minutes). I believe that’s because the lateral movements are more common when printing it horizontally. Additionally, the horizontal version didn’t just have the obvious overhang on the top, but a second overhand on the bottom. I didn’t realize it at first, but then I saw it was highlighted in red. In future projects I’ll double-check by looking at the red highlights. When it came out, comparing both overhangs gave me a good benchmark for what I could get away with. The curves on the sides are ok, and because the overhangs aren’t super big (~inch) they almost worked.  I learned that the 3MF file is more specific whereas the STL file is more general. For instance, the 3MF file can save support structures, while the STL file will just save the original shape. The horizontal version came out very well, it feels durable and the small overhangs/notches worked. However, there was a small notch that we confirmed was an artifact of the print by looking at the gcode file. The outcome of the vertical print is below.     </p>
